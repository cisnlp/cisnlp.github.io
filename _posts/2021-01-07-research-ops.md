The aim of these tutorials is to equip the PhD students with tools, techniques and best practices in doing their research, regardless of their topic. 

These will be two-hour long weekly (or as required) tutorials open to public and given by experienced researchers. The idea is to help the young researchers in being more productive and learn from the best practices the world over. To give you an idea of the theme, some tentative topics are as follows :

- Book-keeping of Deep Learning training
- Advanced PyTorch techniques
- Mixed Precision Deep Learning 
- GIT Version Control
- Debugging in Python 
- Best Practices in supervision of Bachelor/Master Thesis 
- Python environments/basic bash scripting
- Invertible Neural Networks
